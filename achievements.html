    <p>
      Manmohan Singh's tenure as Prime Minister and his earlier role as Finance
      Minister were marked by transformative achievements. He spearheaded
      India’s economic liberalization in 1991, opening the economy to global
      markets. As PM, he implemented landmark initiatives like the MGNREGA for
      rural employment, the RTI Act for transparency, and the Right to Education
      Act, ensuring free education for children. His government launched the
      National Rural Health Mission to improve healthcare and signed the
      historic Indo-US Nuclear Deal for energy security. Singh also laid the
      groundwork for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and maintained a steady
      economic growth trajectory during his leadership.
