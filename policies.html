      <strong>Policies by Manmohan Singh:</strong>
      Manmohan Singh's policies focused on economic growth, social welfare, and
      governance reforms. Key initiatives included economic liberalization in
      1991, which opened India to global markets, and the implementation of
      MGNREGA for rural employment. His government enacted the Right to
      Information Act to enhance transparency and the Right to Education Act to
      make education a fundamental right. Singh prioritized healthcare with the
      National Rural Health Mission and signed the Indo-US Nuclear Deal for
      energy security. Additionally, he promoted fiscal discipline through the
      FRBM Act and prepared the foundation for the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
